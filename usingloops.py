##An algorithm for working out the sum of a range of numbers in a for loop
# total = 0
# for x in range(1, 30):
#     print(f"x now has the value {x}")
#     total = total + x

# print(f"The sum of all numbers from 1 to 30 = {total}")

for x in range(1, 6):
   for y in range(1, 4):
       print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")
